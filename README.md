## about
interested in building a super simple webserver to handling requests from some of my CLI applications (e.g. OAuth requests).

following the super helpful tutorial [on building a simple webserver](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-01-single-threaded.html).

will augment things as i go...still very early...this is fun, though! 😃
